    "## Practice MCQs (AP CSP Style)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A rural school district receives new funding to upgrade its internet infrastructure. Which of the following outcomes could most unintentionally widen the digital divide in that district?  \n",
    "   A. The new broadband network is never advertised, leaving only a few families aware of its availability.  \n",
    "   B. The infrastructure upgrade is offered only at the main high school, leaving feeder schools with minimal connectivity.  \n",
    "   C. The district requires a mandatory device insurance fee, which students in underserved areas may still struggle to pay.  \n",
    "   D. Community organizations host digital literacy workshops in the evenings for families with limited scheduling flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <details><summary>Show Answer</summary>\n",
    "   The correct answer is C. While limited locations or poor advertising can pose challenges, a mandatory insurance fee is most likely to perpetuate financial barriers for lower-income students, further widening the gap.\n",
    "   </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A national organization donates refurbished laptops to multiple low-income neighborhoods. Which scenario best illustrates a hidden challenge that can derail this well-intentioned effort?  \n",
    "   A. The donated laptops run older operating systems but fully support common productivity software.  \n",
    "   B. The neighborhoods receive data-capped internet plans, making streaming and frequent updates cost-prohibitive.  \n",
    "   C. The organization arranges part-time digital literacy instructors to teach basic computer skills.  \n",
    "   D. Each laptop comes with built-in parental controls that require an additional subscription for advanced features.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <details><summary>Show Answer</summary>\n",
    "   The correct answer is B. While older machines or parental controls may pose minor inconveniences, data caps severely limit usage, preventing true accessibility and further entrenching the digital divide.\n",
    "   </details>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A city introduces an online public forum for local policy decisions to increase civic participation. Which action would best mitigate the risk of digital inequalities in this process?  \n",
    "   A. The city mandates all participants to use encrypted messaging apps to ensure authenticity of input.  \n",
    "   B. The city holds in-person ‚Äútech sessions‚Äù and subsidizes internet costs for underrepresented districts.  \n",
    "   C. The forum only allows posting during non-business hours to ensure server reliability for all users.  \n",
    "   D. The city partners with a private data analytics firm to filter out irrelevant comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "   <details><summary>Show Answer</summary>\n",
    "   The correct answer is B. Offering both digital literacy training and subsidizing internet costs actively reduces barriers to participation, addressing core issues of the digital divide.\n",

    "## Homework Hack  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write 5 sentences describing what you have noticed about the digital divide in your own community. Consider how socioeconomic factors, location, and access to technology may play a role. Then explain how you can personally help bridge this gap‚Äîperhaps through awareness, advocating for policy changes, or supporting community-based tech programs. Make sure each sentence provides a clear insight or action step. Submit your 5 sentences in the next class."
